			<blockquote><p>- We have clarified the aforementioned problems because they could be avoided in relational databases. The relational configuration is a logical configuration that uses implicit relationships instead of using explicit relationships, which are used in both hierarchical and networked databases.
 In order to clarify the concept of implicit relationships between relational database files and how to use them in compiling data with each other from separate files from each other, we suppose that we have two tables in the database, table [A] and table [B].  Table [A] defines the sales area for each seller using the seller's number as a key field, and table [B] identifies the name of each seller and the two tables are separate from each other, that is, there is no natural connection between them, and the relationship is implicitly determined by entering the field of the seller's number in each of the two tables.
 Thus, we have reviewed the historical sequence and completed the definition of database management systems (dbms), the most widespread types and their usefulness for data management.
 Perhaps one of the main reasons for the existence of specialized database management systems;  It is the actual need to support a central database for multiple applications as well as multiple users on the same application.
 DBMS systems come in many types, and with different advantages, but in general they seek to achieve three important goals:
 Data Consolidation
 This objective refers to the possibility of combining or consolidating separate data files in a centralized structure, storing data in a redundant-free format;  Which is created in the database when it is stored in two or more locations. For example, we may find the employee’s scientific specialization stored not only in the personal data table, but also in the jobs table, and the job history table, and then we are in front of a decentralized database that contains redundant information, and therefore should if  We wanted to build an ideal, integrated, and redundant system that contains the employee's specialization in one table.
 Data Sharing
 That is, the ability of the system to allow multiple users to access independent pieces of data within the database at the same time, and this is a feature of DBMS applications with what is known as concurrency.
 Data protection:
 That is, the ability of the dbms to maintain the integrity of the data in the face of emergency incidents during processing (program failure or sudden stop .. etc.), as the DBMS should have the ability to return the data to its previous state before incomplete modification or before the error occurred in it and it is called  This process is sometimes undo (undo).
