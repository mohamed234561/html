 Network DBMS management systems
 Relational DBMS
 Hierarchical DBMS:
 Hierarchical databases or hierarchical systems DBMS organize data in a hierarchical form or in the form of an inverted tree, that is, its root is at the top and branches come out of it.  This structure is like the family tree, it has one grandfather and the grandfather has several sons, and the sons are the fathers of the grandchildren, and it is impossible for a grandson to have more than one father.  This is an illustration to show you the hierarchical systems and their branches

 Hierarchical files are files that have the same tree structure and have the same relationships between records, an example of some types of records that can exist in a hierarchical configuration, there are multiple sales records for each seller where there is one statistics record for each ongoing process, and there are also many records for customers for each seller as each seller  It has specific customers, and each customer can have several accounts receivable records, one record for each unpaid purchase.
 It is important to understand that it is not necessary for all the files in the database to communicate with each other.  All that is required is that the files that are used as a group communicate with each other in the applications.
 And past sales records have such a logical relationship called category.  The Set class is a set of records connected to each other logically.
 Thus, a hierarchical database is a collection of files and file categories that are logically connected to each other.
 The information management system (IMS), prepared by IBM, uses hierarchical configuration, which is one of the largest and most complex dbms database management systems currently in existence.  For this reason, it requires a high level of expertise to be able to build it, and in any case, it is strong and has proven great efficiency in dealing with very large databases. It also provides good retrieval and security procedures, in addition to the possibility of using it in the active communication system through the communication network.
 Network dbms:
 Although the word network has been used a lot in computer networks and data processing, it has been found that it is better to use the name Plex databases, although the name network databases is still commonly used.
 The network structure data structure overcomes the obstacles of hierarchical formation, which does not allow a son to have more than one father

 This type of database solves many problems of relationships. If we assume that there is more than one supplier that supplies spare parts, then each supplier is able to supply more than one quality of spare part, and therefore each spare part is supplied by more than one supplier, which makes it necessary to understand the example showing the relationship between the spare part  and suppliers
 From this figure, it is clear to us beyond any doubt that simplifying the network relationship into a hierarchical relationship created more complications as it turned it into two types of relationship tree, and in this an additional effort in implementation.

 What we presented about tree relationships (hierarchical) and networked databases confirms that both can be achieved, although some database management packages can only deal with the tree form, and others can deal with the network type, and there are a variety of database management programs, some programs  Hierarchical database management does not deal with simple relationships and some can handle complex relationships.
