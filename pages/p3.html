			<blockquote><p>-  This type of database solves many problems of relationships. If we assume that there is more than one supplier that supplies spare parts, then each supplier is able to supply more than one quality of spare part, and therefore each spare part is supplied by more than one supplier, which makes it necessary to understand the example showing the relationship between the spare part  and suppliers
 From this figure, it is clear to us beyond any doubt that simplifying the network relationship into a hierarchical relationship created more complications as it turned it into two types of relationship tree, and in this an additional effort in implementation.

 What we presented about tree relationships (hierarchical) and networked databases confirms that both can be achieved, although some database management packages can only deal with the tree form, and others can deal with the network type, and there are a variety of database management programs, some programs  Hierarchical database management does not deal with simple relationships and some can handle complex relationships.
 The similarities between networked database systems and hierarchical database systems are that they require large-sized memories and usually require sophisticated languages ??for programming, which are difficult to learn and have many advantages. They are of course more efficient than relational databases and deal with a very large amount of data and information in addition to  It provides based on the way data is organized by large areas of data storage media.
 Relational DBMS
 Time has proven the correctness of the popular saying that the simplest is the most beautiful and most efficient.  The simpler your residence is, the more simple you live, the more problems will be away from you, and the simpler the machine will be, the easier it will be to manage and maintain it.  This was confirmed by dealing with hierarchical and networked databases whose files and management methods were so complicated that they almost led to them whenever new applications or new requirements were added that needed new indicators, which made them huge and complex.
 These problems were the basis for searching for solutions that would achieve a number of goals, including:
 1 - The database can be understood by those who have not studied computer science
 2 - It is possible to modify, add and delete data without changing the logical schema of the rule.
 3 - Allows the user the highest degree of flexibility in dealing with data
 In 1970, E.E.Codd developed a method for organizing and sorting database data.  They are relational databases.
 The American scientist E.E. Codd found that this can only be achieved by looking at the data in the form of tables, because the person has been accustomed to the tables since his childhood, starting from the table of classes to the multiplication table to revealing names and degrees.
 These systems deal with more than one file at the same time and treat the data inside the file as if it were a table made up of rows and columns, and it is called a relationship. The columns of the table represent the fields of the database, also called Attributes, while their rows represent the database records and they are called tuples. The relational system connects  Data between relationships based on a common field between them.
 Relational systems were based mainly on relational theories in mathematics, and they were first applied to large computers, such as SQL.  ORACLE Then several relational systems appeared on personal computers, such as DBaseII programs.  DBaseIII .  DBaseIII+ .  DBaseIV .  FoxBase .  FoxPro .
 The following can be said about this type of database
 Organizing data in relational databases in two-dimensional tables and each table can be considered a file and uses the term Flat File because the contents of the file are arranged on two axes x, y only.
 A new set of terms has emerged that is used to describe relational databases. These terms are used to describe hierarchical or networked databases. In the relational model, the term Relational Data Submodel or View is used instead of the Subschema. The term View is appropriate.  for the beneficiary part of the database.
 In addition, names were used to describe the components of flat files. The following table shows a sample of a file. The columns of the file are referred to as a vertical flat (range) and to the rows as a horizontal flat. The table is a collection of horizontal planes specific to a specific topic, and the table is for vendors and can be used to provide their names  And their sales since the beginning of the year.

 We have clarified the aforementioned problems because they could be avoided in relational databases. The relational configuration is a logical configuration that uses implicit relationships instead of using explicit relationships, which are used in both hierarchical and networked databases.
 In order to clarify the concept of implicit relationships between relational database files and how to use them in compiling data with each other from separate files from each other, we suppose that we have two tables in the database, table [A] and table [B].  Table [A] defines the sales area for each seller using the seller's number as a key field, and table [B] identifies the name of each seller and the two tables are separate from each other, that is, there is no natural connection between them, and the relationship is implicitly determined by entering the field of the seller's number in each of the two tables.
