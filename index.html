 Database Management Systems
 Most commercial companies, especially in developed countries, began storing and saving their files on the computer since 1960. Computer scientists and experts developed theories and methods to develop how to reuse and increase the efficiency of using these files stored inside the computer, which are called mechanized files. Thus, computer terms appeared and developed to express the uses of these files.  Files and also used methods to process these files Almknh.
 Large files are stored in a large database and contain all recorded data that can be used at a later time. This base is called a Database.
 Because databases are very important and influential in all major areas and activities.  Therefore, certain systems are required to organize and manage the stored data.  This is what is called Database Management Systems, abbreviated as DBMS.
 Database management systems are defined as the programs that help create databases, deal with them, and run the data stored in them.  For example, after adding new customers to the phone book, you need to arrange the names again alphabetically or arrange their addresses.  In other words, it allows the user to add new data, update the data, and print reports in the format they want, such as lists, tables, forms, invoices...etc.
 The database may be very large and contain thousands of billions of words, and it is larger than the existing memory. As a result, the DBMS had to process and manage data in the secondary memory. There are many programs designed for this purpose, including those that run on mainframes or on personal computers.  PCs.
 And such programs: DBASE IV, Clipper, Paradox, Oracle, FoxBase, FoxPro, SQL, DMS, IDMS, our beautiful program MS Access and many of these programs in various versions..
 The data management system consists of a set of files in addition to the program or group of programs that combine to solve a problem or to convert a manual system into a computer-based system, such as converting a system of customer accounts or warehouse accounts from a manual ledger system to a system and files used by a computer. These programs with system files  It is called a database management system, or it may include a group of programs in addition to system files. In this case, the programs collectively called the database management system..
 Far from the complexities and without going into details, database management systems provided the required flexibility for file management systems that were used before.
 But all we want to know is that serial files, binary files, and random files have the largest role in the transition from the file system to the database system.
 Types of DBMS
 Therefore, data models are the representation of real world data in a way that is easy to use by the computer, and there are types of data models that depend on the database management system used as well as on the nature of the data.
 Hierarchical DBMS
